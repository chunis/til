How to install Asian Input to Arch+Gnome


This simple note is for Arch with Gnome3 Desktop environment, but should be similar to other Linux distributions.
It shows how to install both Japanese and Chinese input, and for for Chinese, "rime" supports both Pinyin and Wubi.
This method bases on ibus; another good option would be based on Fcitx.

1. install fonts
You can install one big font for all Asian characters like:
	$ sudo pacman -S adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts
or only installed all the fonts only needed such as only for Chinese:
	$ sudo pacman -S wqy-microhei

2. change the locale
* Edit file '/etc/locale.gen', uncomment below lines:
	ja_JP.UTF-8 UTF-8  
	zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8  
  then run:
  	$ sudo locale-gen

3. Install ibus:
	$ sudo pacman -S ibus
   And put below lines to your '~/.xprofile':
   	# ----------------------------
   	# Settings for Japanese input
	export GTK_IM_MODULE='ibus'
	export QT_IM_MODULE='ibus'
	export XMODIFIERS=@im='ibus'

	#Toolbar for anthy
	ibus-daemon -drx
   	# ----------------------------


4. install Inputs (Anthy or Mozc for JP; rime or sunpinyin or libpinyin for CN):
	$ sudo pacman -S ibus-anthy
	$ yay -S ibus-mozc
	$ sudo pacman -S ibus-sunpinyin
	$ sudo pacman -S ibus-libpinyin
	$ sudo pacman -S ibus-rime 
   Note:
   	*. rime supports both Pinyin and Wubi, so it's a good option if you need both
	*. ibus-mozc is a AUR package, so you need a tool such as yay to install it

5. logout of Gnome and login again. This step is critical for adding Regions.

6. Open "Settings" -> "Region & Language", add all Input to "Input Sources" section.

7. Now run below command as a normal user to add the input to "Input Method":
	$ ibus-setup
