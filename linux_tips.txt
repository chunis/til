## re-map F1 to Escape key

My T400's Esc key is located on the top-right far away from others,
while my X260 has it in the left side of F1. So when using Vim, I kept
touching F1 when I wanted to 'Esc'. So better to remap F1 to Esc.

Tools: Xmodmap && Xkeycaps
Xkeycaps can be used to get the key name, so you know you should use
'Escape' instead of 'Esc' in Xmodmap's config file.

$ echo 'keysym F1 = Escape' > ~/.Xmodmap
$ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
