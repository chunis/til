How to enable ssh login to Raspberry Pi as 'root'


Just a quick fix. Not sure if this causes security issue or not. :-(

1. Change file "/etc/ssh/sshd_config":
   a. line containing "PermitRootLogin" changes to: "PermitRootLogin yes"
   b. "UsePAM yes" changes to "UsePAM no"
2. Restart sshd service by command:
   $ sudo service ssh restart
