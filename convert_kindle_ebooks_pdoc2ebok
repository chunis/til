Some ebooks when be sideloaded to Kindle, they becomes "PDOC" and not "EBOK".
The problem is when you look up some words from dictionary, they won't be saved as "New Words".

The easiest way is use Calibre plugin "Quality Check":
	https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins/wiki/Quality-Check
just use option "Fix" ==> "Fix ASIN" is enough.


Other options:
- use MobiPerl's "mobi2mobi" command (but I haven't verified it):
	$ mobi2mobi --outfile output-file --exthtype 113 --exthdata some-ASIN-number input-file
	$ mobi2mobi --outfile output-file --addexthtype 501 --exthdata "EBOK" input-file

- use "Java Mobi Metadata Editor": https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=165729
