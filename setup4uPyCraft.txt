Notes about how to set up the environment to run uPyCraft

uPyCraft(https://github.com/DFRobot/uPyCraft_src) is an IDE for playing
MicroPython on ESP32 and ESP8266. However, its document about how to prepare
for running it under Linux is too complex and not necessary.

Below are the steps to do it instead under GNU/Linux Debian Sid. Some
libraries should also be installed using pip3, but not tested.

sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-doc qt4-qtconfig qt4-demos qt4-designer
sudo apt-get install libqwt5-qt4 libqwt5-qt4-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-wxgtk4.0 
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-sip
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4.qsci  # this is for qscintilla2
sudo pip3 install pyserial pyflakes

This steps are for python2 instead of python3, maybe useful:
sudo apt-get install python-sip
sudo apt-get install python-qt4  # note: just "qt4" instead of "pyqt4".
sudo apt-get install python-qscintilla2
sudo pip install pyserial pyflakes
