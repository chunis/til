Some Notes about SDR

Just some notes about SDR(Software-Defined-Radio) learn today.

1. Softwares:
  * Linux: Gnu-Radio; GQRX; CubicSDR, SDRangel(SDRangelove under Debian),
	  Baudline, inspectrum
  * Windows: SDRSharp(SDR#); Gnu-Radio;

2. To control HackRF One, you can verify it directly based on the project
"github.com/mossmann/hackrf/". The Wiki has some useful informations.

3. To access HackRF One as a regular user under Linux, you need to add some
udev rules, such as below lines (make sure you're belong to group 'plugdev':
	$ sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/52-hackrf.rules
ATTR{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTR{idProduct}=="604b", SYMLINK+="hackrf-jawbreaker-%k", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
ATTR{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTR{idProduct}=="6089", SYMLINK+="hackrf-one-%k", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
ATTR{idVendor}=="1fc9", ATTR{idProduct}=="000c", SYMLINK+="hackrf-dfu-%k", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
then run this to enable the udev rules without reboot your linux:
	$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules; sudo udevadm trigger

4. I struggled half a day but my HackRF One still doesn't work under my Linux, it
complains "Input/Output Error" with GQRX. I checked with hackrf_info and it
shows the FW version is "2014.08.1". Maybe that's the reason, and I may have to
upgrade the FW and try it again later.
