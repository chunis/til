How to set up tools to read PHP source code


Mainly verified it under Linux(Debian/Sid@2016.12), should also works under
Windows, although need some modifications.
The first 2 ways should be easier under Windows.


** A. Use Editor 'Atom'

1. Make sure you've installed these packages:
	project-manager
	php-server
	atom-ctags
	php-integrator-base
	php-integrator-navigation
	atom-autocomplete-php
	hyperclick
2. "File" -> "Open Folder" to open your PHP code directory.
3. "Packages" -> "Project Manager" -> "Save Project" to save the code as a project.
4. "Packages" -> "PHP Integrator" -> "Set up current project".
4. "Packages" -> "PHP Integrator" -> "Forcibly (Re)Index Project".
Now you should be able to go the defination just by click.


** B. Use 'PHPXref'

1. download version '0.7.1' from: http://phpxref.sourceforge.net/, and extract it somewhere.
2. you may need to change the perl script a bit. Just remove the function 'defined' from below lines:
	637 1117 1157 1725 1728 1857 1860 1863
3. Modify file 'phpxref.cfg', change these configs:
	SOURCE=...
	PROJECT=...
	OUTPUT=...
	CHARSET=...  (such as CHARSET=utf-8 if necessary)
4. run './phpxref.pl'
5. turn to your browser with below url:
	file://<path_to_your_OUTPUT_directory>/nav.html
Enjoy the source code. :-)


** C. Use 'Vim' with 'ctags'.

For PHP, you need a better 'ctags', such as 'phpctags'.
$ sudo apt-get install composer
$ cd <your_PHP_source_code_directory>
$ composer require vendor/nikic
$ composer require phpunit/phpunit  # not sure if this is needed or not
$ curl -Ss http://vim-php.com/phpctags/install/phpctags.phar > phpctags
So, time to produce the 'tags' file. You may add more arguments to suit your requirement.
$ php phpctags -R   # produce the 'tags' file. You may add more arguments to suit your requirement.

Now just viming any of your php code, and use 'ctrl-]' or 'gd' or 'gD' to jump.
