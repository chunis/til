How to set battery charge limit under Linux


This just done in my Lenovo Thinkpad X260, under GNU/Debian Sid at 2016.12.28.
Maybe also works for other Linux based on Lenovo Thinkpad, but not tested yet.

Just run below commands:
$ git clone https://github.com/teleshoes/tpacpi-bat.git
$ cd tpacpi-bat/
$ ./install.pl
Now set it: (1 for main, 2 for secondary, 0 for either/both)
$ sudo ./tpacpi-bat -s SP 1 95 # stop main battery charging at 95%
$ sudo ./tpacpi-bat -s SP 2 95 # stop secondary battery charging at 95%
$ sudo ./tpacpi-bat -s SP 0 95 # stop either/both charging at 95%

Other ways include: use TLP(Linux Advanced Power Management), or change bios
settings, or install kernel module 'tp-smapi-dkms', check it here:
